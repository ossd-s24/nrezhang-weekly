## Group Presentations

Listening to this weeks presentations was super fun to see. Despite the various projects, various characters, and various levels of contributions, I definetly could tell that everyone presenting learned a lot about open source and contributing to it. I definetly enjoyed seeing the different projects, as well as listening to people talk about it, becuase some groups had a real passion for their projects, which is very contagious to listen to. It was also nice to see that other groups had the same struggles as us, and being able to relate to the presentations definetly made it more engaging for me.

## Project updates

We have finalized our presentation, and met to practice going over our presentation. We have trouble keeping it within the time limit, but it should be fine by the time we present on monday. I looked into some small code issues, but it seems like the issue I chose to tackle was more complicated than it seemed. I will talk about this in the presentation, but my fix was not satisfactory for the maintainers.
